# Worklog Part 1
- created a repository with hello world function
- created an account on AWS cloud 
- sorted out how Lambda service works 
- created Lambda function with Hello world 
- connected API Gateway from Lambda service web interface
- read about Github Actions 
- found a solution on Internet(https://github.com/philschmid/blog-github-actions-aws-lambda-python) and forked it 
- installed node.js and npm (for serverless tool)
- created AWS access keys to my account 
- installed AWSCLI (to configure access keys locally)
- updated the code of existing solution 
- updated serverless npm package (the old one didnâ€™t work)
- deployed Lambda (https://36l0aq62q7.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello)
- added access keys to Github repository
- pushed the code to Github repository and checked that Github Actions work 

# Worklog Part 2
- without having a direct url to API (it wasn't provide in task description), I decided to work with static data 
- created an algorythm to display a new item each second
- updated the algorythm to put sequence of elemets (3)
- found an error when a number of elements is not divided by 3 without a remainder
- added extra conditions to output partial sequence (<3) without errors
- added json package to output the list (which was in original solution)
- pushed the new version to Github 
- checked that the new version was deployed to AWS
